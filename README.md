As a part of the of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate , the final course is a capstone project to implement the technical skills taught in this course (excel/googlesheets, sql, r). For this case I used sql on Google Cloud's BigQuery for data exploration. 

# Scenario: 
I am a junior data analyst working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and meet different characters and team members. Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women

# Task: 
Sršen has tasked me to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply these insights to Bellabeat products. 

# The data: 
I will use public [data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)  that explores smart device users’ daily habits. This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
